    <p id="#text">
        Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, <br>
        and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would <a id="link" href="p5.html">sail</a> about a little <br>
        and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and <br>
        regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; <br>
        whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my <a id="link" href="p3.html">soul</a>; whenever I find myself involuntarily <br>
        pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet--<br>
        then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. <br>
        This is my substitute for pistol and ball. <br>
