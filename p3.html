        Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; <br>
        consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy <br>
        to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, <br>
        so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but <br>
        encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not <br>
        off from that isle, thou canst never return! <br>
