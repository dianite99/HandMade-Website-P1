    <p>
        Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, <br>
        which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, <br>
        there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning <br>
        him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; <br>
        and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair <br>
        of putting it in a comprehensible form. <br>
